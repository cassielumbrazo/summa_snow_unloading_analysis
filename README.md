This repo is created to host analysis related to manuscript 2021WR030852 submitted to AGU WRR, 

### Evaluating multiple canopy-snow unloading parameterizations in SUMMA with time-lapse photography characterized by citizen scientists

**Manuscript Main Points**
* Remote time-lapse cameras and citizen science shed light on forest-snow interception processes that are often overlooked.
* Site specific interception patterns, such as wind dominated unloading and riming, impact the transferability of unloading parameteriztions 
* The choice of unloading shceme impacts the canopy albedo feedback, and the partitioning of snow on the ground vs canopy-sublimation
